# NYC Airbnb Listings – EDA Report

This project explores Airbnb listings across New York City to understand trends in pricing, availability, and listing types. Through data cleaning and visualization, I aimed to uncover insights that reflect how the short-term rental market operates in different areas of the city.

## What Was Done?

- Handled missing values in key fields like `name`, `reviews_per_month`, and `last_review`.
- Analyzed listing counts by **room type** and **neighborhood group**.
- Compared **average prices** across neighborhoods and room types.
- Identified **hosts** with the most listings to spot large-scale operators.
- Highlighted the most **expensive areas** and the most **active neighborhoods**.
- Used clear visualizations to support each discovery.

## What the Data Reveals?

- A few hosts control a large number of listings and indicating a strong business presence.
- Entire homes/apartments come at a much higher cost than shared or private rooms.
- Manhattan leads in price, while Brooklyn has a large number of listings at lower rates.
- Price patterns vary noticeably between neighborhood groups.
